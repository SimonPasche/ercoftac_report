\begin{abstract}
    We investigate the nonlinear dynamics and modeling of the \KSE.
    Both the common parallel equation with periodic boundary conditions, as well as a non-parallel equation on an infinite domain, are considered.
    In both equations, we report three cases where the stable solution is the trivial solution, a simple periodic orbit of a single frequency, and a more complex periodic orbit exhibiting multiple harmonics.
    In particular, the parallel periodic equation has analytical eigenvalues and eigenmodes, which allow an simple characterization of the Hopf bifurcation.
    The various types of solutions are demonstrated with phase portraits.
    Next, we compute POD-DEIM modes and reduced-order models for the parallel equation.
    Not only does POD-DEIM capture the limit cycle with a comparatively small number of modes, but also, transient modes correctly capture the limit cycle, and limit cycle modes correctly capture the transients.

\section{Introduction}

The \KSE\ is a fourth-order partial differential equation in time and one-dimensional space that arises in many physical phenomena.
The equation was independently discovered by \cite{KuramotoPTP76} in the context of wave propagation in reaction--diffusion systems, and \cite{SivashinskyAA77} in the context of laminar flames.
Since then, the equation has also been derived for thin film flows, interfacial instabilities, drift waves in plasmas \citep[see][]{KevrekidisSIAMJAM90}, Tollmien--Schlichting waves in flat-plate boundary layers \citep{FabbianeAMR14}, and many more applications.

One of the features that makes the \KSE\ a common model problem is the complex hierarchy of attractors for different equation parameters.
The range of stable solutions, as discussed by \cite{KevrekidisSIAMJAM90}, includes fixed points, simple periodic orbits, more complex periodic orbits (e.g., exhibiting multiple frequencies), quasi-periodic orbits, and ultimately chaos.
Therefore, many attempts have been made to characterize the equation's complex dynamics using simple reduced-order models.
In particular, some works \citep[e.g.,][]{AubrySIAMJSC93, RowleyPD00} have successfully taken advantage of symmetry properties to improve proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) models.

Proper orthogonal decomposition---also known as principal component analysis and Karhunen--Lo\`eve expansion---is a very common data-based modal decomposition, and is discussed in works by \cite{SirovichQAM87} and \cite{HolmesTCSDSS}.
Given a set of data snapshots, the technique extracts orthogonal modes that optimally capture the energy of the input data.
These modes are then typically used in Galerkin models to form reduced order models.
Despite the popularity of POD-based reduced order models, the technique suffers from a number of shortcomings.
For instance, the kinetic energy of POD modes do not necessarily correlate to their importance in the dynamics, especially if some low-energy mode may trigger instabilities.
The choice of modes to retain in reduced-order models, therefore, may be difficult to determine \citep[see, e.g.,][]{IlakPF08}.
In addition, POD models generally have no stability guarantees.
Finally, the construction of nonlinear terms in POD models may be computationally expensive.

The discrete empirical interpolation method \citep[DEIM;][]{ChaturantabutIEEECDC09, ChaturantabutRice09a} addresses the last concern by intelligently selecting discrete points in the domain for which the nonlinear term is computed, and neglecting all other points.
The DEIM method has been shown to be very computationally efficient and to create very accurate POD models.
Although error bounds have been derived for DEIM, the precise reasons for its success have not been rigorously proven.

In this report, we cover two topics related to the \KSE.
First, we use linear stability theory and computation to characterize the equation's simple attractors.
Second, we demonstrate the success of POD-DEIM reduced-order models for this equation.
The \KSE\ and POD-DEIM are first reviewed in \autoref{sec:theory}.
Next, the attractors are described in \autoref{sec:attractors}, and the application of POD-DEIM is demonstrated in \autoref{sec:pod-deim}.
Finally, we summarize our work in \autoref{sec:conclusions}.
