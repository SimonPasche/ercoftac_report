* Compiling

  To generate the PDF, run the normal LaTeX-BibTeX-LaTeX-LaTeX cycle:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  for cmd in pdflatex bibtex pdflatex pdflatex
  do
      $cmd BeltranChenCookePasche
  done
  #+END_SRC

  The output will be written to =BeltranChenCookePasche.pdf=.

* Generating figures

  To generate MATLAB figures, see the script =figures/plot_example.m=.  This
  script includes the bells and whistles that will make the plots look uniform
  among the authors.
